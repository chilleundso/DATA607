## Introduction

We have chosen to investigate the coronavirus data set provided by Johns Hopkins University which themselves source the data from DXY, an online platform run by members of the Chinese medical community.

We combine this data with data sourced through the API of Numbeo which provides country information on various indicators, including health care and quality of life.

Our goal is to investigate wether we can identify any correlation between any of these indicators and either the mortality rate (i.e. death per confirmed case) or the death per capita.



   
## Loading required libraries

We load all required libraries:

```{r load_libraries, eval=TRUE, results='hide',message=F, include=T, warning=F}
library(httr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(date)
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Downloading Covid-19 Data {.smaller}

We download three seperate CSV (for confirmed cases, recoveries and deaths) from the John Hopkins GitHub account and save them as data frames:

 
```{r data_download,eval=TRUE, include=T}

urlRemote  <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/"
pathGithub <- "CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/"
```

```{r ,eval=TRUE, include=T}

fileConfirmGlobal <- "time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv"
fileDeathsGlobal <- "time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv"
fileRecovGlobal <- "time_series_covid19_recovered_global.csv"
```

```{r ,eval=TRUE, include=T}

confsGlobal <- read.csv(paste0(urlRemote, pathGithub, fileConfirmGlobal),header = TRUE)
deathsGlobal <- read.csv(paste0(urlRemote, pathGithub, fileDeathsGlobal),header = TRUE)
recovsGlobal<- read.csv(paste0(urlRemote, pathGithub, fileRecovGlobal),header = TRUE)

```


## Downloading Country Population {.smaller}
We download data which includes population size, ISO2 and ISO3 codes per country to later be able to merge it with other country indices

```{r data_download_countryISO,eval=TRUE}

urlRemote  <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/"
pathGithub <- "chilleundso/DATA607/master/Final_Project/"

countryISOfile <- "UID_ISO_FIPS_LookUp_Table.csv"

countryISOfull <- read.csv(paste0(urlRemote, pathGithub, countryISOfile),header = TRUE)

```



## Data Clean-up {.smaller}

As we can see in the above table the data is provide in a long format. In the below section we transform all 3 data frames to take long format:

```{r create3tables,eval=TRUE}
#Creating a long table using gather
confs <- tidyr::gather(confsGlobal, "Date", "Amount", -Province.State, -Country.Region, -Lat, -Long)
confs <- confs %>%
  select(Country.Region, Date, Amount,) %>%
  group_by(Country.Region, Date) %>%
  summarise(Amount = sum(Amount))
#transforming the date column into a date structure:
confs$Date<-as.Date(confs$Date,format='X%m.%d.%y')
#adding a status label to flag data belongs to confirmed data set
confs$Status <- 'confirmed'


```

We do the same transformation for the data sets with recovery and death information

```{r create3tables2,eval=TRUE,include=F}
#Creating a long table using gather
recovs <- tidyr::gather(recovsGlobal, "Date", "Amount", -Province.State, -Country.Region, -Lat, -Long)
recovs <- recovs %>%
select(Country.Region, Date, Amount,) %>%
group_by(Country.Region, Date) %>%
summarise(Amount = sum(Amount))
#transforming the date column into a date structure:
recovs$Date<-as.Date(recovs$Date,format='X%m.%d.%y')
#adding a status label to flag data belongs to recovered data set
recovs$Status <- 'recovered'

#Creating a long table using gather
deaths <- tidyr::gather(deathsGlobal, "Date", "Amount", -Province.State, -Country.Region, -Lat, -Long)
deaths <- deaths %>%
select(Country.Region, Date, Amount,) %>%
group_by(Country.Region, Date) %>%
summarise(Amount = sum(Amount))
#transforming the date column into a date structure:
deaths$Date<-as.Date(deaths$Date,format='X%m.%d.%y')
#adding a status label to flag data belongs to deaddata set
deaths$Status <- 'dead'

kable(head(confs))

```

## Retrieve latest date for each country and widen  {.smaller}

We retrieve the latest date for each country in each of the 3 data frames
```{r latest_per_country,eval=TRUE, message=F}
#retrieve the latest date for each file
require(data.table)

latestconfs <- as.data.table(confs)
latestconfs <- latestconfs[latestconfs[, .I[Date == max(Date)], by=Country.Region]$V1]

latestrecovs <- as.data.table(recovs)
latestrecovs <- latestrecovs[latestrecovs[, .I[Date == max(Date)], by=Country.Region]$V1]

latestdeaths <- as.data.table(deaths)
latestdeaths <- latestdeaths[latestdeaths[, .I[Date == max(Date)], by=Country.Region]$V1]

```

We stack and then widen the 3 data frames

```{r combine_latest_in_master,eval=TRUE}
#we stack all three data sets underneath each other
latestmaster <- rbind(latestconfs,latestrecovs,latestdeaths)
#we then widen the data set to have three new columns one for each amount of confirmed, recovered and dead cases:
latestmasterwide <- tidyr::spread(latestmaster,Status,Amount)

```


## Resulting Master table {.smaller}

```{r show_master,eval=TRUE}
kable(head(latestmasterwide)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```


## Merging Country Population and Corona Metrics {.smaller}

```{r add_ISO_master, echo=TRUE}
master <- merge(latestmasterwide, countryISOfull, by.x = "Country.Region", by.y = "Combined_Key",all.x = TRUE)


```

```{r add_measures}
master$death_per_10kcapita <- master$dead / master$Population *10000
master$death_per_confirmed <- master$dead / master$confirmed
```


```{r showfinal}
kable(head(master))%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

## Numbeo Data  {.smaller}

Numbeo is the world's leading cost of living database, and it also provides many quality-of-life metrics for comparisons across cities and countries.  We used these metrics to examine whether any quality-of-life rankings may be correalted with varying death rates across countries. In addition, we also pulled in obesity rates from CIA World Factbook as an additional variable to explore.

## Sourcing Country Indices via API and CSV {.smaller}

Sourcing Country Indices via API from numbeo
```{r, message=F,warning=F}


request <- fromJSON("https://numbeo.com/api/rankings_by_country_historical?api_key=x2mmjp3a6651i3&section=12")
quality_life <- request$`2020`

obesity <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pmalo46/DATA607-1/master/Final_Project/obesity.csv")
indices <- left_join(quality_life, obesity, by = "country")

```

## Country Indices {.smaller}

```{r}
kable(head(indices)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped") %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")

```

## About Numbeo's Metrics {.smaller}

It is importnat to note that many of the Numbeo metrics are calculated based on surveys taken by the site's userbase. Thus, there may be inherent selection bias built into some of the scores. For instance, the healthcare index is calculated in part by using surveys of users experiences within certain countries, and accounts for many facets of a countries system, including quality, price, and accessibility.  The climate index is also noteworthy, as it functions more as a climate-likability score, than a temperature index.

<!-- Change name of coutry code column to merge with master -->

```{r, include=F}
names(indices)[names(indices) == "iso3166_country_code"] <- "iso2"
names(indices)
```

## Merge the two data sets into Final data set {.smaller}
```{r}
df_merged <- left_join(indices, master, by = "iso2")
kable(head(df_merged))
```
```{r}
df <- subset(df_merged, select = -c(iso3, Country.Region, Date))
head(df)
```

## Comparing death per confirmed case and per capita {.smaller}
```{r}
m_confrimVcapita <- lm(death_per_confirmed ~ death_per_10kcapita, df)
summary(m_confrimVcapita)
```

## Comparing death per confirmed case and per capita {.smaller}
With an adjusted R squarred of 64% we can see that these two measures of the response to corona do explain a large proportion of their respective variability. Clearly the death per confirmed case highly depends on the amount of testing that is being done in each of the countries but we do see that there is a high degree of correlation between the two.

```{r,warning=F,results=T,echo=FALSE,fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(df, aes(x= death_per_confirmed, y= death_per_10kcapita)) + 
                  geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=country),hjust=0, vjust=-0.5) + geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y  ~ x )
```


## Analysis of death per confirmed cases {.smaller}
```{r fig.height = 3.9, fig.width = 6}
pair_var <- c(2:5, 7:12, 17, 18)
pairs(df[pair_var])
```

Judging by these pair plots, it looks like the most interesting correlations for death rates among confirmed cases might be cpi_index, quality_of_life_index, climate_index, obesity_rate, and possibly pollution_index and healthcare_index

## Death Per Confirmed Cases Overview {.smaller}

The countries with the 20 highest deaths per confirmed cases:

```{r,warning=F,results=T,echo=FALSE,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9}

dfshort1 <-arrange(df,-death_per_confirmed)[0:20,]

ggplot(dfshort1, aes(x =reorder(country, death_per_confirmed) , y = death_per_confirmed)) +
  geom_col( width = 0.7) + 
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Country") +
  ylab("Death Per Confirmed Cases")
```

## Analysis of death per confirmed cases (cont'd) {.smaller}

We run regressions on ourvariables of interest to look for a correlation

```{r eval=TRUE}
m_health <- lm(death_per_confirmed ~ healthcare_index, df)
#summary(m_health)
m_pol <- lm(death_per_confirmed ~ pollution_index, df)
#summary(m_pol)
m_qol <- lm(death_per_confirmed ~ quality_of_life_index, df)
#summary(m_qol)
m_clim <- lm(death_per_confirmed ~ climate_index, df)
#summary(m_clim)
m_obes <- lm(death_per_confirmed ~ obesity_rate, df)
#summary(m_obes)
m_cpi <- lm(death_per_confirmed ~ cpi_index, df)
#summary(m_cpi)
```

## Deaths per confirmed cases vs Climate index {.smaller} 

It seems like climate index is the only variable that has any statistical significance at all. Let's take a closer look at that.
```{r}
summary(m_clim)
```

## Deaths per confirmed cases vs Climate index {.smaller}
```{r climplot, warning=F,results=T,echo=FALSE,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9}
ggplot(df, aes(x=climate_index, y=death_per_confirmed)) + geom_point() + geom_text(aes(label=country),hjust=0, vjust=-0.5) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y~x)
```

## Deaths per confirmed cases vs Climate index {.smaller}

This suggests that climate may have an effect on death rates. However, Numbeo's climate index statistic is not an average temperature, but rather a "climate-likability" index, meaning it is more along the lines of a probability that the average person will enjoy this climate.  Thus, warm but temperate climates are more likely to score higher, whereas more extreme or uncomfortable climates score lower.  So this could either mean that the virus may be less lethal in more extreme climates, or it could be that death rates are higher in areas people are more likely to live.

## Death Per Capita Overview {.smaller}

The countries with the 20 highest deaths per capita:

```{r,warning=F,results=T,echo=FALSE,fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9}

dfshort <-arrange(df,-death_per_10kcapita)[0:20,]

ggplot(dfshort, aes(x =reorder(country, death_per_10kcapita) , y = death_per_10kcapita)) +
  geom_col( width = 0.7) + 
  coord_flip() +
  xlab("Country") +
  ylab("Death Per Capita (per 10'000)")
```

## Analysis of Death Per Capita {.smaller}

We repeat the analysis of death per confirmed case with deaths per capita (per 10'000 inhabitants), fitting it to various country indicators:

```{r}
m_health2 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ healthcare_index, df)
#summary(m_health2)

m_pol2 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ pollution_index, df)
#summary(m_pol2)

m_qol2 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ quality_of_life_index, df)
#summary(m_qol2)

m_clim2 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ climate_index, df)
#summary(m_clim2)

m_obes2 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ obesity_rate, df)
#summary(m_obes2)

m_cpi2 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ cpi_index, df)
#summary(m_cpi2)

m_purchpower2 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ purchasing_power_incl_rent_index, df)
#summary(m_purchpower2)
```
          
## Purchasing Power vs Death Per Capita Summary {.smaller}

Purchasing Power has the largest adjusted R squared amongst the models with ~12%.

```{r}
summary(m_purchpower2)
```

## Purchasing Power vs Death Per Capita Graph {.smaller}

As we saw in the summary output table there is a positive correlation between Purchasing Power and deaths per capita. This is somewhat counter-intuitive but looking at the countries in the top right corner we can see that "wealthier" Western countries are pulling up the regression.

```{r,warning=F,results=T,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x= purchasing_power_incl_rent_index, y= death_per_10kcapita)) + 
                  geom_point() +
                  geom_text(aes(label=country),hjust=0, vjust=-0.5) + 
                  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y  ~ x ) +
                  xlab("Purchasing Power") +
                  ylab("Death Per Capita (per 10'000)")
```


## Health Care vs Death Per Capita Summary {.smaller}

Health Care Rating has an adjusted R squared of ~7%, therefore, explains only very little of the variability of the death per capita.

```{r}
summary(m_health2)
```

## Health Care vs Death Per Capita Graph {.smaller}

Similar to the purchasing power also the health care rating looks to be positively correlated to death per capita. It, therefore, seems that the quality of the health care is not as important factors in estimating the death per capita.

```{r,warning=F,results=T,echo=FALSE}


ggplot(df, aes(x= healthcare_index, y= death_per_10kcapita)) + 
                  geom_point() +
                  geom_text(aes(label=country),hjust=0, vjust=-0.5) + 
                  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y  ~ x ) +
                  xlab("Health Care Rating") +
                  ylab("Death Per Capita (per 10'000)")

```


```{r,warning=F,results=T,echo=FALSE,include=F}

dfless1 <- dplyr::filter(df, death_per_10kcapita < 1 )
m_health3 <- lm(death_per_10kcapita ~ healthcare_index, dfless1)
summary(m_health3)

ggplot(dfless1, aes(x= healthcare_index, y= death_per_10kcapita)) + 
                  geom_point() +
                  geom_text(aes(label=country),hjust=0, vjust=-0.5) + 
                  geom_smooth(method='lm', formula= y  ~ x )
```

## Conclusion {.smaller}

We can see that, contrary to what we would have anticipated, we have a positive correlation between health care rating and the deaths per capita. The countries that stick out especially are Belgium, Spain, Italy, the UK and France. They all have a death per capita of more than 4 per 10 thousand. while having a relatively well rated health care system.
  
It seems like there is a large divide between the European countries and the rest of the world (specifically the Asian countries). Looking at the countries with the best rated healthcare we clearly see that Asian countries have a much lower death rate (less than 5 per million inhabitants) while the Western countries with similar ratings have 20 to 100 times higher rate of death per capita. This might have more to do with the response and ability to lock down the economy effectively versus western countries:

```{r,warning=F}
head(arrange(df, desc(healthcare_index))[,c(1,4,17)])


```
